> * Added a username to the session super global variable (in the authentication.php) in order to be able to use relational database in monitoring the user activity within the application (using of the user session) on every page of the application. This is will be used to query the user on all other pages. I needed this beacause I noticed that the admin users tables was only queried during authentication.
> * Created a table in the database to store users activit. This table holds the session id, the user id, the username and the activity performed by the user (such as login, adding member, logout, etc)
> * added the possibility to read the users activity from a log file in the log directory. This meansn whatever is pushed to the database table for the user activity is also written in a log.txt for easy reference.
