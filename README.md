# Installation Instructions for Non-PHP Devs
> First, thank you to everyone who is taking the time to work on this project. Although this section might be a little redundant but if you're not a PHP Dev and you want to have an idea on how the project should function, please follow the instructions below.

> PS: I am assuming you're running a windows machine

1. Go to [this site](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) and download the WAMP application for windows (this application creates a virtual server on your local machine - for PHP to run).

2. Install the app (as administrator) and keep pressing "next" using all default installation settings. If installation wasn't successful, please paste screenshot of error in the whatsapp group and you'll surely get help. If installation was sucessful, then Thank God and go to the next step.

3. Assuming your computer's base directory is C, go into the directory C:wamp64/www and create a folder called projects.

4. Clone this repo, unzip it and dump the folder MAINCHURCH-MASTER inside the "projects" folder you just created

5. Now launch WAMP and check your windows icon-tray at the right hand side. You should see the WAMP ICON highlight a green color (if it's yellow, then something is wrong). Right click the green WAMP icon, hover on "Your VirtualHost" and it should reveal another menu. Then click on "VirtualHost Management" in the revealed menu. It should look like the image below; ![virtualHost Management Img](https://res.cloudinary.com/michael89/image/upload/v1550610896/1_x0ppo0.jpg)

6. On clicking the link above, it should open your Internet Explorer (or the browser you set for WAMP) and You should have a screen with the information as displayed below.
